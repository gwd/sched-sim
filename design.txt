Discrete event simulator to speed the development and analysis of
different scheduling algorithms for the new scheduler.

Inputs: Scheduler, Workload description

Hmm... compile in all scheduler variants...?

scheduler callbacks {
  init processor,
  init VM,
  schedule,
  wake,
  block
}

scheduler interface {
  insert event (perhaps just SCHEDULE event)
}

Workload description:
  To begin, wake / block lists; all unconditional.
  Later, deal with "dropped" work (e.g., video, audio)?
  Dependencies (dom0, stubdoms, driver doms)?

Types of event:
* Wake
* Block
* Schedule timer
